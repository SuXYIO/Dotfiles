# Dotfiles

## Intro :information_source:

A place to put some of my **dotfiles**.  
More complex config (such as [NeoVim](https://github.com/suxyio/Nvim_Conf)) are in my other repos.

## Usage :calling:

**[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)** is recommended.  
Run

```bash
stow foo
```

in this directory  
Where `foo` is the package you wanna link.  
For example: `stow zshrc` links the `zshrc` package.
